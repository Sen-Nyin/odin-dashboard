## Dashboard - The Odin Project

This work was done for the final project of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) Intermediate HTML & CSS within the Full Stack JavaSript Path.

# Tech Used

* Sass (Scss) was used to generate the CSS.
* HTML 5

# Methods utilised

The layout predemonantly uses CSS Grid, with the occasional FlexBox thrown in where only a 1 diminsional component was needed.
Media queries are used throughout to allow responsive design.

# Difficulties

Thankfully I had no difficulties with this one as I've spent quite a bit of time practicing CSS Grid with [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.com) challenges. You'll find all my FEM projects in my repos.

# Learnings

I took the opportunity to familiarise myself more with transitions in CSS for this project - something I feel I've underutilised in the past.
